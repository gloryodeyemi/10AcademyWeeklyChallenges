# WEEK 2 CHALLENGE

## Project
User Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry - Overview

## Business Need
You are working for a wealthy investor that specializes in purchasing assets that are undervalued. This investor’s due diligence on all purchases includes a rich analysis of the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the
business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus of which products or services are being offered. 


Your last role with this investor saw you do a rich analysis of a delivery company and you helped to identify that delivery to university students was the most profitable route to
follow, and your analysis helped the investor purchase this delivery company and ramp up profits by 25% within 6 months through focussing on the most profitable aspect of the business. This was driven by university students always being hungry, awake at all
hours, willing to purchase from a limited food menu and tending to live within a small geographical area.


The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial
information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems.


Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling. You will do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network.
