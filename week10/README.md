## Project
Moodle Database: Educational Data Log Analysis

## Business Need
Many educational facilities such as colleges, universities, bootcamps rely on scalable and versatile Learning Management Systems. 


The Moodle LMS  is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
It is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors. 
With customizable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals. 
Moodle allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community-sourced plugins.


In 2019, 10 Academy used the Moodle LMS to manage about 1000 students in their 6 months data science training. Learners, course instructors, 
and all admins interacted with the Moodle system for almost all the training activities. All events from these activities are 
logged in the moodle postgres database. 


10 Academy, like any other educational facility, is interested to understand the learners skill and knowledge development, 
and is interested to build models that are able to predict possible dropouts as well as classify learners into doing, well, 
doing ok, and struggling groups. 10 Academy is also interested in automating the process of reminding learners approaching 
deadlines, providing quick feedback based on their overall community engagement and performance. Moreover, given the main 
goal of 10 Academy training is to make students job ready, it wants to measure students' performance across many relevant metrics. 


## Objective
Assuming a role-model of a freelancer hired by 10 Academy, you are to explore the 10 Academy Moodle logs stored in 
the database together with many other relevant tables. By the end of your analysis, you are expected to build a Tableau 
dashboard that illustrates the progress of students across time.
